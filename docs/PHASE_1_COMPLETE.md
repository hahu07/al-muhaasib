## Technical Implementation

### Component Architecture
```typescript
StudentProfile (Container)
├── Loading State (Spinner)
├── Error State (Message + Back Button)
└── Main Content
    ├── Header Section
    │   ├── Back Button
    │   ├── Title + Status Badge
    │   └── Action Buttons (Edit, Pay)
    ├── Grid Layout
    │   ├── Left Column (1/3)
    │   │   ├── Student Details Card
    │   │   └── Guardian Details Card

    │       ├── Fee Assignments Card
    │       └── Payment History Card
    └── Payment Modal (conditional)
```

### Data Flow
```
1. Page Load (URL: /students/{id})
   ↓
2. StudentProfile Component Receives ID
   ↓
3. Parallel Service Calls
   ├── studentService.getById(id)
   ├── paymentService.getByStudent(id)
   └── feeService.getAssignmentsByStudent(id)
   ↓
4. State Updates (student, payments, feeAssignments)
   ↓
5. Component Renders with Data
   ↓
6. User Interaction
   ├── View Details (read-only)
   ├── Record Payment → Opens Modal
   │   ↓
   │   Payment Recorded
   │   ↓
   │   Data Refreshes (step 3 repeats)
   └── Back Navigation → /students
```

### State Management
- **Local State**: `useState` for component data
- **Loading State**: Boolean flag for spinner
- **Error State**: String for error messages
- **Modal State**: Boolean for payment form visibility
- **Router**: Next.js `useRouter` for navigation

### Styling Approach
- **Framework**: Tailwind CSS
- **Responsive**: Mobile-first with breakpoints
- **Theme**: Light/Dark mode variables
- **Colors**: Consistent with design system
- **Typography**: Font weights and sizes from design tokens
