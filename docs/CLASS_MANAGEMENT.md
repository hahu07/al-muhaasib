## Data Model

```typescript
interface SchoolClass {
  id: string;
  name: string; // e.g., "Primary 1"
  section?: string; // e.g., "A", "Science"
  level: "nursery" | "primary" | "jss" | "sss";
  capacity: number; // Maximum students
  currentEnrollment: number; // Current students
  room?: string; // Physical location
  academicYear: string; // e.g., "2025/2026"
  isActive: boolean; // Show in registration?
  teacherId?: string; // Assigned teacher
}
```

## Validation Rules

### Name

- Required
- Minimum 1 character

## Visual Features

## Statistics Dashboard

Displays 4 key metrics:

1. **Total Classes**: Count of all classes
2. **Total Capacity**: Sum of all capacities
3. **Enrolled**: Total students enrolled
4. **Available**: Remaining capacity

## Best Practices

### When to Create Classes

- At the start of academic year
- When opening new sections
- When adding new grade levels

### Naming Conventions

- Use consistent format: "Primary 1", "JSS 2", "SSS 3"
- Sections: Use A, B, C or Science, Arts, Commercial
- Room: Use building/block reference

### Capacity Planning

- Set realistic capacities based on physical space
- Monitor enrollment percentages
- Adjust capacity if needed (but not below enrollment)

### Active Status

- Keep inactive classes for historical data
- Only active classes appear in student registration
- Can reactivate classes for new academic year

## Comparison: Dynamic vs Seed Data

### Seed Data (Quick Start)

**Pros**:

- ✅ One-click setup
- ✅ 20 pre-configured classes
- ✅ Good for testing/demo
- ✅ Covers all levels

**Cons**:

- ❌ Fixed structure
- ❌ May not match school's needs
- ❌ Generic names/sections
- ❌ Can't customize before creation

### Dynamic Creation (Recommended)

**Pros**:

- ✅ Complete control
- ✅ Match your school exactly
- ✅ Create only what you need
- ✅ Edit anytime
- ✅ Professional workflow

**Cons**:

- ❌ Takes more time initially
- ❌ Requires manual entry

### Best Approach

1. **Option 1**: Start with seed data, then edit classes to match your school
2. **Option 2**: Create classes manually from scratch (recommended for production)
3. **Option 3**: Mix - seed data for testing, manual for production

## Future Enhancements

### Phase 2

- [ ] Bulk class creation
- [ ] Class templates (duplicate existing class)
- [ ] Academic year wizard (create all classes for new year)
- [ ] Teacher assignment from class management
- [ ] Class timetable integration

### Phase 3

- [ ] Student list per class
- [ ] Move students between classes
- [ ] Class reports (enrollment history)
- [ ] Export class lists
- [ ] Print class rosters

## Screenshots & Examples

### Empty State

```

### Class Card Example

```
┌─────────────────────────────┐
│ Primary 1 A          [Edit] │
│ PRIMARY              [Delete]│
│                              │
│ Enrollment:  15 / 30  [50%] │
│ ████████████░░░░░░░░ (green) │
│                              │
│ Room: Room B1                │
│ Academic Year: 2025/2026     │
│ Status: Active               │
└─────────────────────────────┘
```

### Statistics

```
[Total Classes: 20] [Capacity: 650] [Enrolled: 485] [Available: 165]
```

## Technical Details

### Service Integration

```typescript
// Create
await classService.create(classData);

// Update
await classService.update(id, classData);

// Delete
await classService.delete(id);

// List
const classes = await classService.list();

// Get active
const active = await classService.getActiveClasses();
```

### Caching

- Service layer caches classes for 3 minutes
- Automatic cache invalidation after create/update/delete
- Manual refresh available

### Error Handling

- Form validation before submission
- Service-level error handling
- User-friendly error messages
- Console logging for debugging

## Migration from Seed Data

If you used seed data and want to clean up:

```typescript
// Option 1: Edit each class individually (recommended)
// Navigate to /classes and use edit button

// Option 2: Delete and recreate (not recommended)
// Delete classes one by one, then create fresh

// Option 3: Keep seed data and supplement
// Seed data is valid, just add/edit as needed
```

## Testing Checklist

- [ ] Create new class
- [ ] Edit existing class
- [ ] Delete empty class
- [ ] Try to delete class with students (should fail)
- [ ] Search classes by name
- [ ] Filter classes by level
- [ ] Check statistics accuracy
- [ ] Verify progress bars
- [ ] Test capacity validation
- [ ] Test active/inactive toggle
- [ ] Mobile responsive check
- [ ] Dark mode check
