# Juno Initialization Fix

## Issue
Pages like `/classes` and `/students` were throwing error:
```
No satellite ID defined. Did you initialize Juno?
```

## Root Cause
Juno's `initSatellite()` was only called in the home page (`/page.tsx`), so when users navigated directly to other routes (like `/classes`), Juno wasn't initialized.

## Solution

Created a global `JunoProvider` component that initializes Juno once at the root level.

### Changes Made

**1. Created JunoProvider** (`src/components/JunoProvider.tsx`)
- Initializes Juno satellite globally
- Shows loading state while initializing
- Shows error state if initialization fails
- Wraps all children once initialized

**2. Updated Root Layout** (`src/app/layout.tsx`)
- Added `JunoProvider` wrapper
- Now all pages have Juno initialized

**3. Cleaned Home Page** (`src/app/page.tsx`)
- Removed duplicate initialization
- Simplified component

## How It Works

```
Root Layout
  └── JunoProvider (initializes Juno once)
      └── ThemeProvider
          └── All Pages (/, /students, /classes, etc.)
              └── Can now use Juno services!
```

## Benefits

✅ **Single Initialization**: Juno initialized once for entire app
✅ **Works Everywhere**: All pages can now use Juno services
✅ **Better UX**: Shows loading state during initialization
✅ **Error Handling**: Displays helpful error if Juno config is wrong
✅ **No Duplicates**: Removed duplicate initialization code

## Testing

All pages should now work:
- ✅ `/` - Home/Dashboard
- ✅ `/students` - Student List
- ✅ `/students/[id]` - Student Profile
- ✅ `/classes` - Class Management

## Configuration

Juno satellite ID is configured in `juno.config.mjs`:
```javascript
satellite: {
  ids: {
    development: "atbka-rp777-77775-aaaaq-cai",
    production: "<PROD_SATELLITE_ID>",
  }
}
```

## Next Steps

If you still see initialization errors, check:
1. Juno satellite ID is correct in `juno.config.mjs`
2. Internet connection is available
3. Juno service is running
