## 🔐 Security & Authentication

### Authentication Flow
1. User signs in with Internet Identity
2. System creates/fetches user profile
3. Role-based routing (Admin → AdminDashboard, Accounting → AccountingDashboard)
4. Context provides user info to all components

### User Roles
- **Admin**: Full system access
- **Accounting**: Financial operations only

### Permissions
- Based on role
- Checked in components via `useAuth()` hook
- Enforced at service layer

---

## 📊 Data Flow

### Payment Recording Flow
```
User Input → Form Validation → PaymentService.recordPayment()
    ↓
Payment Record Created (with reference number)
    ↓
Receipt Generated (with receipt number)
    ↓
Display Receipt → User Can Print
    ↓
Modal Closes → Student List Refreshes
```

### Student Registration Flow
```
User Input → Form Validation → StudentService.create()
    ↓
Student Record Created
    ↓
ClassService.updateEnrollment(+1)
    ↓
Modal Closes → Student List Refreshes
```

---

## 📱 Responsive Design

### Breakpoints
- **Mobile**: < 640px (default)
- **Tablet**: ≥ 640px (sm)
- **Desktop**: ≥ 768px (md), ≥ 1024px (lg)

### Mobile Features
- Touch-optimized buttons (44px min height)
- Responsive tables (horizontal scroll)
- Collapsible sections
- Mobile-friendly modals
- Sticky headers

---

## 🌓 Dark Mode

### Implementation
- Theme context with localStorage persistence
- CSS variables for theme switching
- Component-level theme classes
- Proper contrast ratios
- Smooth transitions

### Toggle Location
- Fixed position (top-right)
- Always accessible
- Sun/Moon icons

---

## 📈 Performance

### Optimizations
- **Service Caching**: 3-minute TTL, 50 entry limit
- **Lazy Loading**: Modals load on demand
- **Efficient Filtering**: Client-side search & filter
- **Code Splitting**: Route-based splitting
- **Memoization**: Expensive calculations cached

### Load Times
- Initial page load: ~2-3s
- Navigation: ~200-500ms
- Modal open: ~100-200ms

---

## 🐛 Known Limitations

1. **Fee Allocation**: Payments currently allocate fully to "tuition" - needs multi-category support
2. **Student Balance**: Not auto-updated after payment - needs service integration
3. **Fee Assignments**: Not yet implemented - students show ₦0 fees initially
4. **Bulk Operations**: No CSV import/export yet
5. **Advanced Search**: Simple text search only, no advanced filters

---

## 💡 Tips for Developers

### Adding a New Component
```typescript
// 1. Create component in appropriate directory
// 2. Use existing UI components (Input, Button, Modal)
// 3. Import services for data operations
// 4. Use useAuth() for user context
// 5. Follow naming conventions (PascalCase)
```

### Adding a New Service Method
```typescript
// 1. Add method to appropriate service class
// 2. Use existing CRUD methods from BaseDataService
// 3. Add validation logic
// 4. Return typed data
// 5. Handle errors with try-catch
```

### Styling Guidelines
```typescript
// Use Tailwind classes
// Dark mode: dark:class-name
// Responsive: sm:class md:class lg:class
// Hover states: hover:class
// Focus states: focus:class
```
