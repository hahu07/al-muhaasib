# Dynamic Allowances & UI Improvements

## Changes Made - October 24, 2025

### 1. Dynamic Allowances Implementation

Staff allowances are now **dynamic** (one-time per payment) instead of recurring. This allows for more flexibility in salary payments.

#### Changed Files:

**Type Definitions:**
- `src/types/index.ts`: Removed `isRecurring` property from `StaffAllowance` interface
- `src/satellite/src/modules/staff/mod.rs`: Removed `is_recurring` field from Rust `StaffAllowance` struct

**UI Components:**
- `src/components/staff/StaffForm.tsx`:
  - Removed recurring toggle (Switch) from allowances section
  - Removed `isRecurring` from `AllowanceForm` interface
  - Simplified allowance input to just name and amount
  
- `src/components/staff/StaffDashboard.tsx`:
  - Removed "ðŸ”„ Recurring" badge from allowance display

- `src/components/staff/SalaryPaymentForm.tsx`:
  - Removed auto-population of allowances from staff data
  - Allowances must now be entered manually for each payment
  - Added comment explaining the change

**Service Layer:**
- `src/services/staffService.ts`: Removed `isRecurring` from sample staff data

#### Key Benefits:
- **Flexibility**: Allowances can vary month-to-month
- **Accuracy**: Each payment reflects actual allowances paid
- **Control**: Admin has full control over each payment's allowances
- **Transparency**: Clear what was paid in each specific salary payment

#### Migration Notes:
- Existing staff records with `isRecurring` field will still work (backward compatible)
- New staff records will not have this field
- Salary payments require manual entry of allowances per payment period

3. **Create/Edit Bonus Form**:
   - Enhanced with gradient background (blue-50 to white)
   - Added border-2 with blue accent

6. **Typography & Contrast**:

#### User Experience Improvements (All Three Modals):
- âœ… Clearer visual hierarchy across all financial modals

## Testing Recommendations

1. **Test Dynamic Allowances**:
   ```bash
   # Start dev server
   npm run dev
   
   # Test scenarios:
   - Create new staff member with allowances
   - Process salary payment (allowances should not auto-populate)
   - Manually add different allowances for different months
   - Verify total compensation calculations
   ```

2. **Test Staff Financial Management UIs**:
   ```bash
   # Navigate to Staff â†’ Select staff â†’ Bonus/Penalty/Loan Management
   
   # Verify:
   - Summary stats display correctly with proper colors
   - Create/Issue forms are visually distinct
   - Filter dropdowns work with new emoji labels
   - Cards show clear status and amounts
   - Dark mode looks good across all modals
   - Mobile view is responsive and stacks properly
   - Color schemes match purpose (green=loans/bonuses, red=penalties)
   - Hover effects work smoothly
   ```

3. **Type Safety**:
   ```bash
   # Run TypeScript check
   npx tsc --noEmit
   
   # Run linter
   npm run lint
   ```

## Deployment Notes

**Satellite Functions (Optional):**
If you want to deploy the Rust changes to Juno:
```bash
juno functions build
juno functions publish
```

**Frontend Deployment:**
```bash
npm run build
juno hosting deploy
```

## Rollback Instructions

If you need to revert these changes:

```bash
# Revert to previous commit
git log --oneline  # Find commit before changes
git revert <commit-hash>

# Or restore specific files from git
git checkout HEAD~1 src/types/index.ts
git checkout HEAD~1 src/components/staff/StaffForm.tsx

## Future Enhancements

Potential improvements for consideration:

1. **Allowance Templates**: Create reusable allowance templates
2. **Allowance History**: Track allowance changes over time per staff
3. **Bulk Allowance Management**: Apply allowances to multiple staff at once
4. **Allowance Categories**: Group allowances (Transport, Housing, etc.)
5. **Allowance Rules**: Set min/max limits per allowance type
