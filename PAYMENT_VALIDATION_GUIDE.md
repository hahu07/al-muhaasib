# Payment Validation System for Al-Muhaasib

## Overview

The Al-Muhaasib school management system includes a comprehensive payment validation system implemented using Juno's `assert_set_doc` hooks. This system ensures data integrity, business rule compliance, fraud prevention, and audit compliance for all payment transactions before they are written to the blockchain.

## Architecture

### Validation Hook Structure

```rust
#[assert_set_doc(collections = ["payments"])]
fn assert_set_doc(context: AssertSetDocContext) -> Result<(), String> {
    match context.data.collection.as_str() {
        "payments" => expense_assertions::validate_payment_document(&context),
        _ => Ok(())
    }
}
```

### Payment Data Structure

```rust
pub struct PaymentData {
    pub student_id: String,
    pub student_name: String,
    pub class_id: String,
    pub class_name: String,
    pub fee_assignment_id: String,
    pub amount: f64,
    pub payment_method: String,
    pub payment_date: String,
    pub fee_allocations: Vec<PaymentAllocation>,
    pub reference: String,
    pub transaction_id: Option<String>,
    pub paid_by: Option<String>,
    pub status: String,
    pub notes: Option<String>,
    pub receipt_url: Option<String>,
    pub recorded_by: String,
    pub created_at: u64,
    pub updated_at: u64,
}
```

## Validation Categories

- ✅ **Maximum Amount**: Payments cannot exceed ₦50,000,000
- ✅ **Decimal Precision**: Maximum 2 decimal places allowed
- ✅ **Allocation Consistency**: Fee allocations must sum to payment amount

**Business Impact**: Prevents erroneous amounts and ensures financial accuracy.

### 3. Payment Method Constraints

**Purpose**: Enforces payment method specific rules based on amount and compliance requirements.

#### Cash Payments

- **Limit**: Maximum ₦500,000
- **Rationale**: Audit compliance and cash handling security

#### POS Payments

- **Limit**: Maximum ₦2,000,000
- **Rationale**: Transaction limits and processing fees

#### Bank Transfers

- **Large Amount Rule**: Over ₦1,000,000 should include transaction reference
- **Rationale**: Audit trail and reconciliation

#### Online Payments

- **Transaction ID**: Always required
- **Validation**: Must be at least 10 characters
- **Rationale**: Digital payment verification

#### Cheque Payments

- **Cheque Number**: Required as transaction ID
- **Format**: Must be at least 6 numeric digits
- **Rationale**: Physical cheque verification

### 4. Date Validation

**Purpose**: Ensures payment dates are realistic and within acceptable ranges.

**Validations**:

- ✅ **Format**: Must be YYYY-MM-DD
- ✅ **Future Limit**: Cannot be more than 30 days in the future
- ✅ **Past Limit**: Cannot be more than 2 years in the past
- ✅ **Business Days**: Weekend payments over ₦100,000 require justification

**Business Impact**: Prevents backdating abuse and unrealistic future payments.

### 5. Status Workflow Validation

**Purpose**: Enforces proper payment status transitions and workflow compliance.

#### Status Transitions

```
pending → confirmed, cancelled
confirmed → refunded
cancelled → (no transitions)
refunded → (no transitions)
```

#### Status-Specific Rules

- **Cancelled**: Must include cancellation reason in notes
- **Refunded**: Must include refund explanation in notes
- **New Payments**: Can start as 'pending' or 'confirmed'

**Business Impact**: Maintains payment audit trail and prevents invalid status changes.

### 6. Fee Allocation Validation

**Purpose**: Ensures payments are properly allocated across fee categories.

**Validations**:

- ✅ **Minimum Allocations**: At least one allocation required
- ✅ **Maximum Allocations**: Cannot exceed 20 allocations
- ✅ **Amount Matching**: Total allocations must equal payment amount (±₦0.01)
- ✅ **Category Information**: Each allocation needs category ID, name, and type
- ✅ **Fee Type Validation**: Must be valid fee type from predefined list

#### Valid Fee Types

- `tuition`, `uniform`, `feeding`, `transport`, `books`
- `sports`, `development`, `examination`, `pta`, `computer`
- `library`, `laboratory`, `lesson`, `other`

**Business Impact**: Ensures accurate fee tracking and proper revenue allocation.

### 7. Reference Uniqueness

**Purpose**: Prevents duplicate payment references and ensures unique identification.

**Validations**:

- ✅ **Format**: Must follow PAY-YYYY-XXXXXXXX pattern
- ✅ **Uniqueness**: No duplicate references allowed
- ✅ **Year Component**: Must contain valid 4-digit year
- ✅ **Suffix**: 8 alphanumeric characters

**Business Impact**: Maintains payment integrity and prevents reference conflicts.

### 8. Business Rule Enforcement

**Purpose**: Implements school-specific business rules and policies.

#### Large Payment Rules

- **Over ₦1,000,000**: Should specify who made the payment
- **Over ₦5,000,000**: Must include explanatory notes and transaction ID
- **Weekend Payments**: Over ₦100,000 require justification notes

#### Compliance Rules

- **Receipt URLs**: Must be valid format if provided
- **Notes**: Maximum 1,000 characters
- **Paid By**: Maximum 100 characters

**Business Impact**: Ensures compliance with school policies and regulatory requirements.

### 9. Fraud Prevention

**Purpose**: Detects potentially fraudulent or suspicious payment patterns.

**Validations**:

- ✅ **Round Number Detection**: Large round amounts require detailed notes
- ✅ **Transaction ID Validation**: Format specific to payment method
- ✅ **Reference Uniqueness**: Prevents duplicate payment creation
- ✅ **Amount Reasonableness**: Flags suspicious patterns

#### Fraud Detection Rules

- Amounts ending in "0000" over ₦100,000 need detailed notes
- Online transactions need proper transaction references
- Cheque numbers must be valid format

**Business Impact**: Reduces fraud risk and improves payment security.

### 10. Student Verification

**Purpose**: Ensures payments are associated with valid students and classes.

**Validations**:

- ✅ **Student ID**: Minimum 3 characters
- ✅ **Student Name**: Must contain alphabetic characters
- ✅ **Class Information**: Class ID and name minimum lengths
- ✅ **Fee Assignment**: Must be properly linked

**Business Impact**: Prevents payments for non-existent students and maintains data integrity.

## Integration with Frontend

### TypeScript Service Layer

The payment validation works seamlessly with the existing `paymentService.ts`:

```typescript
// This will trigger validation hooks
const payment = await paymentService.recordPayment({
  studentId: "STU001",
  studentName: "Ahmad Musa",
  amount: 75000,
  paymentMethod: "bank_transfer",
  // ... other required fields
});
```

### Error Handling

Validation errors are returned as descriptive strings:

```typescript
try {
  await paymentService.recordPayment(invalidPaymentData);
} catch (error) {
  // Error: "Cash payments cannot exceed ₦500,000 for audit compliance"
  console.error("Payment validation failed:", error);
}
```
